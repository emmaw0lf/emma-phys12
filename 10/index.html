        <p>This week, the assignment was to make a machine that has at least one stepper motor and to demonstrate you can calibrate its position. I wanted to work on the dispensing mechanism for my final project, and this week was actually what convinced me to use a stepper motor. It's a lot more precise and it would be way easier to time for the different amounts of food to dispense.</p>

        <p>First, I had to code the circuit. I had the DRV8834 Low-Voltage Stepper Driver, and I referenced <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2134">the product page</a> for the set up. Here is what I came up with:</p>

        <img src="./circuit.jpeg" alt="circuit" width = "400" height = "350">

        <p>Next, to code the stepper motor itself. I wanted to make a piece that would open and close depending on the time, so I made a *very* rough design for it. Essentially, the DC motor would hang from somewhere and a dowel connected to the mechanism would spin it.</p>

        <img src="./dispensing.jpeg" alt="dispensing mechanism" width = "400" height = "350">

        <p>I next had to make the code, which I based off of <a href="https://lastminuteengineers.com/a4988-stepper-motor-driver-arduino-tutorial/">this website</a>.<br> The code is below:</p>

        <pre style="height: 500px; overflow: scroll;">
            <code>
                // Include the AccelStepper Library
                #include &lt;AccelStepper.h&gt;

                // Define pin connections
                const int dirPin = 12;
                const int stepPin = 13;

                // Define motor interface type
                #define motorInterfaceType 1

                // Creates an instance
                AccelStepper myStepper(1, stepPin, dirPin);

                void setup() {
                  pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
                  pinMode(dirPin, OUTPUT);
                  myStepper.moveTo(200);
                }

                void loop() {
                  digitalWrite(dirPin, HIGH);
                  for (int x = 0; x &lt; 100; x++)
                  {
                    digitalWrite(stepPin, HIGH);
                    delay(2.5);
                    digitalWrite(stepPin, LOW);
                    delay(2.5);
                  }
                 

                }
                delay(1500);
              }     

</code></pre>

<p>Finally, the video on how it works! Obviously, it will be a lot more defined in the final project.</p>
