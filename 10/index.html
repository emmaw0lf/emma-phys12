<center><h1>10: Machine Building and End Effectors</h1></center> 

<p>This week, the assignment was to make a machine that has at least one stepper motor and to demonstrate you can calibrate its position. I wanted to work on the dispensing mechanism for my final project, and this week was actually what convinced me to use a stepper motor. It's a lot more precise and it would be way easier to time for the different amounts of food to dispense.</p>

<p>First, I had to code the circiut. I had the DRV8834 Low-Voltage Stepper Driver, and I referenced <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2134">the product page</a> for the set up. Here is what I came up with:</p>

<p>Next, to code the stepper motor itself. I wanted to make a piece that would open and close depending on the time, so I made a *very* rough design for it. Essentially, the DC motor would hang from somewhere and a dowel connected to the mechanism would spin it.</p>

<p>I next had to make the code, which I based off of <a href = "https://lastminuteengineers.com/a4988-stepper-motor-driver-arduino-tutorial/">this websites</a>. <br> The code is below:</p>



<pre style="height: 500px; overflow: scroll;"><code>

// Include the AccelStepper Library
#include &lt;AccelStepper.h&gt;

// Define pin connections
const int dirPin = 12;
const int stepPin = 13;


// Define motor interface type
#define motorInterfaceType 1

// Creates an instance
AccelStepper myStepper(1, stepPin, dirPin);

void setup() {
  pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(dirPin, OUTPUT);
  myStepper.moveTo(200);
}


void loop() {
  digitalWrite(dirPin, HIGH);
  for (int x = 0; x &lt; 100; x++)
  {
    digitalWrite(stepPin, HIGH);
    delay(2.5);
    digitalWrite(stepPin, LOW);
    delay(2.5);
  }
  delay(1500);
  digitalWrite(dirPin, LOW);

  for (int x = 0; x &lt; 100; x++)
  {
    digitalWrite(stepPin, HIGH);
    delay(2.5);
    digitalWrite(stepPin, LOW);
    delay(2.5);
  }
  delay(1500);
}

</code></pre>

<p>Finally, the video on how it works! Obviously, it will be a lot more defined in the final project.</p>
