  <center><h1>Final Project</h1></center> 

  <p>For my final project, there were quite a few things to do before I started. I needed a list of materials, a timeline, and a plan! I'm making an automatic cat feeder. <br>Here's the list of materials:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Wood</li>
    <li>DC motors</li>
    <li>Round acrylic tube (pet safe!)</li>
    <li>LCD screen</li>
    <li>ESP board</li>
    <li>Button</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For my timeline, I wanted the design completed by July 10th, an LCD interface and app by July 24th, and to assemble it the 29th and 30th. My progress through these steps is below:</p>

  <h1><center>**DESIGN**</center></h1>

  <p>My dispensing mechanism was inspired by a gumball machine, and I based the design off some models I had seen online. It was fun to design, and I'm looking forward to building it!</p> 

  <h1><center>**CODING AND WIRING**</center></h1>

  <p>I worked on the dispensing mechanism week 10, and I used a stepper motor. Eventually, I refined it and made the code:</p>

  <pre style="height: 500px; overflow: scroll;">
    <code>// Include the AccelStepper Library
      #include &lt;AccelStepper.h&gt;

      // Define pin connections
      const int stepsPerRevolution = 200;
      const int dirPin = 12;
      const int stepPin = 13;
      const int ledPin = 8;
      int rotationCW = 0;
      int rotationCCW = 0;
      int sensorValue = 0; //
      int location = 1;

      // Define motor interface type
      #define motorInterfaceType 1

      // Creates an instance
      AccelStepper stepper(1, stepPin, dirPin); 

      void setup() {
        stepper.setSpeed(1500);
        stepper.setAcceleration(1000);
        Serial.begin(9600);
        pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(dirPin, OUTPUT);
        //stepper.moveTo(200);
        pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP);
        pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
     

void loop() {

  digitalWrite(8, HIGH);


  int sensorValue = digitalRead(2);
  Serial.println(sensorValue);

  if (sensorValue == 0) {

    if (location == 1) {

      Serial.println("clockwise");
      digitalWrite(dirPin, LOW);
      rotationCW =  (0.5 * stepsPerRevolution);

      stepper.moveTo(rotationCW);
      location = 2;
      delay(500);
      Serial.println("Location 2");

    } else {
      rotationCCW = (0);
      digitalWrite(dirPin, HIGH);
      Serial.println("counterclockwise");
      stepper.moveTo(rotationCCW);
      location = 1;
      delay(500);
      Serial.println("Location 1");
    }

  }
  stepper.run();
}

<p>The wiring was fairly straight forward since I already had the motor wired. Adding the button was a simple connection.</p>

<center><h1>ASSEMBLY & CUTTING</h1></center> 
<p>This was the most time consuming part, mainly because the laser cutter was being used a lot of the time. I had to cut out the box part, a false bottom the motor would come out of, and the case to hide the wiring. I was able to print almost everything, and I connected them with hot glue. I would've used wood glue except it takes a long time to dry.</p>
<img src="./finalparts.png" alt="final parts" width = "500" height = "400">
<p>After gluing the box together and putting part of the false bottom, I had to wire the button and motor through it. I did this by drilling holes. I re-wired then mounted the metro board and breadboard onto the back, which was a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>Next, I put on the back box.</p>
<img src="./backwiring.png" alt="back wiring" width = "500" height = "400">
<p>I had to attach the dispensing mechanism to the motor which was a pain because the motor's shaft was smooth and hot glue didn't stick. I ended up using a connector. However, a major flaw is that the mechanism isn't level so dispensing can't be as seamless as it would otherwise. I tried for a couple of hours to fix it, but I wasn't able to.</p>

<p> Now, for the place where the food/cat food is held, I used a Pepsi bottle because of the shape. I wish there was something more readily available that looked nicer, but it was what I could use. It wasn't too bad to work with except it isn't as clear as I would've wanted it. I wanted to make a nice lid, except I couldn't cut the top level and that made it very hard. I settled just placing wood over it, but this wouldn't keep the cat food. I hope to fix this in the future. I also had to use tape on the side for padding.</p>

<center><h1>DEMO</h1></center> 
<p>For the demo, I brought the feeder home to test on my cats. The lighting wasn't ideal, and I had to craft a tray because the slope I made didn't work. </p>

  <h1>REFLECTIONS</h1>
</center> 

<p>This project was fun overall. It was a learning process, and reflecting back on it there was a lot of things I'd do differently. Maybe I'd use a waterbottle for the feeder, and also 3D print a more precise dispensing mechanism. I wish I had painted or stained the wood, but I didn't have enough time. I look forward to doing more projects in the future!</p>
