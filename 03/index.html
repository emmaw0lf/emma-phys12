<center><h1>3: Electronics and Tools</h1></center> 

<p> This week, we learned about multiple tools in the lab like saws, drills, and soldering tools. 

<h2><center>**ASSIGNMENT**</center></h2>

<p>This classes assignemt was to make a kinetic sculpture. I decided to make a ferris wheel, since I had actually made one a long time ago in middle school! I had fun designing this, and it wasn't too challenging to put together.</p>

<p>I took it to the lab, laser cut the design, and then used a metal dowel to hold it togehter. I fastened the wheels to it, then rested the dowels on a stand that I had made. I hot glued the motor to the dowel, soldered it, and then connected it to the battery and bam! It spun.</p>

<p>This project made me feel super creative, and I'm glad that I was able to make it. The spacing wasn't super well done between the wheels, and I hope to revisit the project and make it better in the future by fixing the spacing and adding cars!</p>
