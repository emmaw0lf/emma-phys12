<center><h1>4: Microcontroller programming</h1></center> 

<p> This weeks assignment was to program an Arduino board to do something. I wanted to connect a button to a motor to make it run when it was pressed. I was a beginner when it came to coding in Arduino, but I was able to figure out how to use it enough in order to make the button do what I want. <br> Here's my code!</p>

<pre><code>
int buttonState = digitalRead(8);
const int A1A = 3;  // define pin 3 for A-1A 
const int A1B = 4;  // define pin 4 for A-1B 

void setup() {
  pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     
  pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);    
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
}

void loop() {
if (buttonState == HIGH) {
  digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH);
  delay(3000);
  digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);    
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
} else {
  digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
}

}
</code></pre> 

<p>It was really fun learning how to code this, and the sense of accomplishment I felt after learning how to do it was great. I hope to incorporate the code into my final project for the button to dispenser part. </p>


<p> Below is a gif of my Arduino setup and how it works!</p>

<p>Finally, there's the circuit diagram. I wasn't super confident on how to draw it, but in the end I managed to.</p>

<p>Arduino was tough, but having a basic understanding of how it works is so important for my final project, and sticking it out will be worth it in the end. </p>
