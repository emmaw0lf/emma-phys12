<center><h1>6: Electronic Input Devices</h1></center> 

<p>This weeks assignment was to use a sensor from a kit to measure a physical quantity and calibrate it and to fabricate a sensor using copper tape.</p>

<p>For the first part of the assignment, I chose to design a thermistor. I referenced <a href="https://wujibi123.github.io/PHYS_S-12/07_ElectronicInput/index.html"> this</a> to build the circuit, and then I used the code <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/06_input/index.html"> on the website</a> to put into arduino. From there, I had a working circuit!</p>

<p>However, the serial plotter on arduino was having trouble using the data from the code, so I tweaked it slightly and made it so it only printed the number, not the celcius sign or the "temperature:" part. After that, the graph worked!</p>

![Temp graph](./tempgraph.png)

<p>The dips in the graph are from when I touched ice, then the sensor, and the peaks are when I touched the sensor with warm hands.</p>

<pre><code>
int ThermistorPin = A0;
int Vo;
float R1 = 10000;
float R2, T;
float A = 3.354e-03;
float B = 2.5698e-4;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);           
}

void loop() {

  Vo = analogRead(ThermistorPin);
  R2 = R1 * 1/(1023.0 / (float)Vo - 1.0);  //Calculate resistance of thermistor from voltage divider math.
  T = (1.0 / (A + B*log(R2/R1) ));  // Calculate temperature using datasheet formula.
  T = T - 273.15;                   //Convert from Kelvin to Celcius.

  Serial.println(T);

  delay(500);
}
</code></pre>

<h1><center>Second sensor</center></h1>

<p>For the sensor I fabricated, I used copper tape in to make a capacitive sensor, but I accidentally ended up making a touch sensor. This made it so when the copper touched, an LED lit up. It wasn't too challenging wiring this, and I took the code from <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/lab/input/capacitance/txrx.html">here</a> and then modified it so there was an if statement for the LED. I had to find the range, and it roughly was between 0-1500. This meant that when it was over 750, the LED was lit up.</p>

<pre><code>
long result;   //variable for the result of the tx_rx measurement.
int analog_pin = A3;
int tx_pin = 4;


void setup() {
  pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      //Pin 4 provides the voltage step
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  result = tx_rx();
  Serial.println(result);
  if (result > 750) {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  }

}


long tx_rx() {        // Function to execute rx_tx algorithm and return a value
  // that depends on coupling of two electrodes.
  // Value returned is a long integer.
  int read_high;
  int read_low;
  int diff;
  long int sum;
  int N_samples = 100;    // Number of samples to take.  Larger number slows it down, but reduces scatter.

  sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < N_samples; i++) {
    digitalWrite(tx_pin, HIGH);             // Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
    read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);     // Measure response of conductor 2.
    delayMicroseconds(100);                 // Delay to reach steady state.
    digitalWrite(tx_pin, LOW);              // Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
    read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);      // Measure response of conductor 2.
    diff = read_high - read_low;            // desired answer is the difference between high and low.
    sum += diff;                            // Sums up N_samples of these measurements.


  }
  return sum;
