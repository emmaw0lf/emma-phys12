      <h1>2: 2D Cutting</h1>
    </center>

    <p>The assignment for our second lesson was to design and lasercut a press-fit construction kit. I brainstormed many ideas, but ultimately I settled on making a few shapes that would fit together.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <img src="./gear.png" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <img src="./triangle.png" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <img src="./square.png" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>These were the designs I came up with. Fusion 360 was tough for me to understand at first, but once I got it, my designs were a lot easier to make. I put it on a thumb drive and brought it to the laser cutter.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img src="./initial1.png" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img src="./initial2.png" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The first printing was okay, but the fit was a little loose. I also didn't like how the square looked so I decided to focus on the gear and triangle. I made some slight adjustments, then reprinted.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <img src="./final1.png" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <img src="./final2.png" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <img src="./final3.png" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Success!! I finally got a product I liked, and I loved all the funky ways you could combine everything. I had fun doing this project and I hope we do more things like this in the future.</p>

    <h2><center>**ASSIGNMENT**</center></h2>

    <p>The assignment for this class was to measure then model 2 items from the lab. I chose to model a phone as well as a roll of masking tape. Here is me doing some measurements!</p>

    <img src="./measure2.JPG" alt="measuring 2" style="width:50%;margin:auto;display:block;">

    <p>I had a lot of fun modeling them and I'm proud of how they turned outâ€“although there wasn't the right color for my case so I did green, because why not.</p>
