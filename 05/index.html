    <center><h1>Week 5: 3D Printing</h1></center> 

    <p>For this week, we had to 3D print something related to our projects as well as make a 3D scan. I printed out a minature model of the cat bowl that I was going to use for my final project, and I was fairly happy with the result! To figure out how to model it in, I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYihSHdp3js">this tutorial.</a> After watching the tutorial, I sketched out a rough guide for the bowl in procreate.</p>

    <p> After I made the sketch, I exported it to Fusion 360, then roughly sketched over it as well as moved the Fusion sketch.</p>

    <p>I made the sketch 3D by rotating it around the axis, and then I had the file that I could move to PrusaSlicer to then take to the printer.</p>

    <p>I exported the <a download href="./emmabowl1.gcode">G-code</a> from PrusaSlicer, then printed it out!</p>

    <h4><center>3D scan</center></h4>

    <p>Well... the 3D scan went interestingly. I used an app called ScandyPro on my iPhone 11 Pro. It didn't fully scan my neck, and there were a bunch of holes. At least it looks like me...</p>

    <p>...right?<br><br>Ignoring the scariness of it, it was pretty straight forward. The link to my file is <a download href="./me-mm.stl">here.</a></p>
