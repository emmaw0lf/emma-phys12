<center><h1>8: CNC Milling, Molding, and Casting </h1></center> 

<p>This week was super fun to do, but very tedious. We had to design something and make it using CNC, and then create something by molding and casting. I decided to make a heart design in wax with the SRM-20 Mill. </p>

<p> Designing it fusion wasn't hard since I'd gotten the hang of it. I just had to take it to a thumbdrive, bring it the computer connected to the mill, and callibrate it. I played with the settings, and with Suvin's help I was able to get a pretty good cut. The edges were touching the rest of the wax, so it wouldn't have worked great to cast with, but I had a different plan for casting.</p>

<p>My idea for casting was to make a cast of my hand that could act as a jewlery holder! I got skin-safe molding material from Nathan and I got to work.</p>

<p>I read the instructions and watched a tutorial online, and I was confident that I could do it right the first time (spoiler alert- I didn't). I first measured equal parts water to powder. <br>

![mix](./firstmix.png)

Everything was going swimmingly... the mixture looked smooth and perfect... and then... I realized I didn't have enough. So, being the genius I am, I decided to measure more and pour it over. It didn't work and instantly made the mixture lumpy and gross and sadly I had to say goodbye.

</p>

<p>For the second attempt, I made sure to measure plenty and cast it per instructions with warm water. It went well, it was still a bit lower than I would've liked and then I put my hand in.

It was a little painful becuase the position wasn't super comfortable but I managed. I waited then wiggled my finger out. I think my nail scratched it on the way out, but no way to tell until the casting is finished.

I decided to cast with plaster and to be honest, I messed it up majorly. I didn't read the instructions as well as I should've, and I got the wrong ratio and swapped the water and powder and it was just a mess.

The second time went well hopefully well though, but I first need to explain my idea. Since the base wasn't long enough, I decided to put a cup in to make it longer and sturdy. I didn't think to seal it though because I thought it would magically stay in place. It didn't and it leaked a bit, but I think it will be fine.

<p>Finally, the results. I think it turned out well despite a big airbubble in the palm. The nails were a little rugged, but it was really detailed overall!!</p>
